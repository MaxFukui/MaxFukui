- Hello, here the speaker is someone who creates art and codes, sometimes together.

I am increasingly interested in machine learning and data sciencie. I am striving every day to understand this universe and to be able to contribute within this scope.

- my studies today converge in areas of artificial intelligence and, when it happens, in game development.

- this is a temporary description.
